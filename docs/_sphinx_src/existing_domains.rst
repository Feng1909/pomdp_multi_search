Existing POMDP Domains
======================

Several domains have been implemented:

.. autosummary::
   :nosignatures:

   pomdp_problems.multi_object_search.problem
   pomdp_problems.tiger.tiger_problem
   pomdp_problems.rocksample.rocksample_problem
   pomdp_problems.tag
   pomdp_problems.load_unload

Some problems that we hope to implement are below. There are even more examples `here <http://www.pomdp.org/examples/>`_. Contribution is welcomed.

* :doc:`problems/pomdp_problems.light_dark`
* :doc:`problems/pomdp_problems.maze`


In addition, the interfaces in `pomdp_py` are general enough to be extended to e.g. learning, multi-agent POMDPs; see :doc:`extensions`. `Contributions are always welcomed!`
